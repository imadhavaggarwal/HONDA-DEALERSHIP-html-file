                <h3>Maintainence Parts</h3>
                <ul>
                <li><p>Engines, like people, need to breathe clean air to stay fit. Without a free flow of clean air, an engine can't perform at its best. It's the job of your engine's air filter to remove dust and contaminants from incoming air before they can reduce performance, increase fuel consumption and cause premature engine wear. As these pollutants build up on the filter, engine airflow becomes restricted, which adversely affects performance. That’s why it’s important to regularly replace your old, dirty air filter with a new Honda Genuine Engine Air Filter. Made from advanced materials designed for superior filtration and airflow, Honda Genuine Engine Air Filters help optimize performance and fuel economy. Remember, all engine air filters aren’t the same. Insist on original Honda quality. Insist on Honda Genuine.</p></li>
                <li><p>Pollen. Dust. Airborne contaminants. They’re all in the air you breathe every day. Fortunately, you can keep them out of your passenger cabin by inspecting and replacing your Honda’s cabin air filter as recommended. Honda Genuine Cabin Air Filters are designed specifically for your vehicle and meet Honda’s exacting performance and quality standards. They’re engineered to deliver maximum filtration of both incoming and recirculated air. And best of all, they give you the confidence of knowing they meet Honda standards for performance, quality and durability </p></li>
                <li><p>Simply put, your Honda’s timing belt keeps your engine’s valves and pistons working in sync. A broken timing belt will not only shut down your engine immediately, but is likely to result in engine damage and expensive repairs. With so much at stake, why take a chance? Have your timing belt inspected at the recommended intervals — and at replacement time, insist on a Honda Genuine Timing Belt. Honda Genuine Timing Belts are designed for exact factory fit to prevent belt slippage, and constructed with original premium materials for maximum durability and crack resistance. Don’t put your engine at risk with other brands. With a Honda Genuine Timing Belt, you can drive with confidence. </p></li>
                <li><p>A clear, unobstructed view of the road is every bit as vital to the safety of you and your passengers as is the grip of good tires or the stopping power of brakes. In other words, your wiper blades are an essential safety feature in all driving conditions. It’s easy to tell when tires and brakes need attention, but wiper blades are a different story. Because they wear out slowly over time, you might not know they’re worn out until you need them—and that’s the wrong time to find out. That’s why it’s important to periodically inspect and replace them with Honda Genuine Wiper Blades before you find yourself in a risky situation. Honda Genuine Wiper Blades are engineered to strict specifications to provide precise fit, durability and the peace of mind Honda Genuine can deliver.<p></li>

                <h3>Oil & Fluids</h3>
                <ul>
                <li><p>Most people don’t stop to think about the fluid in their automatic transmission. The truth is that fluid in their automatic transmission has a direct impact on how well their transmission shifts, how smoothly it performs, and how long the transmission lasts. Transmission fluid also has a direct impact on your Honda’s fuel economy. Honda Genuine Automatic Transmission Fluid has been thoroughly laboratory-tested, and is specifically formulated to meet the needs of Honda vehicles. It uses the finest ingredients that deliver the ideal friction properties for efficient shifting, economical transfer of power, and a smooth ride with exceptional performance.</p></li>
                <li><p>When you’re driving in extreme temperatures, the last thing you need is engine failure. Whether in extreme heat or cold, Honda Genuine Longlife Blue Antifreeze/Coolant provides long-term corrosion protection to all metal and non-metal parts of your Honda’s cooling system and protects against boil over and freezing. Honda Genuine Longlife Blue Antifreeze/Coolant is the only coolant designed specifically for Honda vehicles. Its pre-mixed formulation is so advanced, no coolant service is required for up to 10 years or 120,000 miles. Use Honda Genuine Longlife Blue Antifreeze/Coolant for optimum long-term engine performance.</p></li>
                <li><p>You put your foot on the brake pedal and the vehicle slows. Sounds pretty simple, doesn’t it? The fact is, your Honda’s braking system experiences significant stress, especially in stop-and-go traffic. Over time, the brake fluid it uses can become contaminated, or simply lose its effectiveness. That’s why Honda recommends replacing brake fluid every three years with Honda Genuine Brake Fluid. Specially formulated to work with Honda braking systems, Honda Genuine Brake Fluid contains moisture inhibitors that help maintain correct lubricity and fluidity in virtually any driving conditions. What’s more, its blend of top-quality ingredients is designed to maintain effectiveness for the full three-year period between recommended changes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Maybe it’s hard to believe that using the wrong power steering fluid is a mistake you can hear. But it’s true. An inferior power steering fluid can allow friction, and friction makes noise. With a higher viscosity than most other power steering fluids, an exclusive blend of friction modifiers and a special base oil (after all, quality starts with the basic ingredient), Honda Genuine Power Steering Fluid is formulated to counter friction effectively, and is 100% compatible with all Honda power steering system components. Help your Honda last longer and run quieter. Always insist on Honda Genuine Power Steering Fluid.</p></li>
                <li><p>Motor oil is your engine’s lifeblood. It lubricates your engine and protects moving parts to keep things running right. With the variety of grades and viscosities available, choosing the right motor oil may seem confusing. Honda Genuine Motor Oils are blended and tested to meet strict Honda requirements, and are available in a variety of grades and viscosities, each formulated specifically for use in Honda engines. You see, Honda engines are designed to work best with lower-viscosity motor oils, and oil not specified for them can diminish engine performance. So how do you pick the right motor oil with so many brands and types to choose from? Easy. Just look for the only motor oil with the Honda name.</p></li>

                <h3>Replace Parts</h3>
                <ul>
                <li><p>It stands to reason that Honda Genuine Brake Rotors function best with Honda Genuine Brake Pads. Particularly since Honda brake pads are extensively tested on Honda vehicles in the most intense braking situations and extreme environments. Made from a balance of hard and soft materials, Honda Brake Pads can effectively help prevent premature disc wear and minimize noise.
                <ul>
                <li>Precisely engineered and manufactured with state-of-the-art materials for superior performance, proper wear and long life.</li>
                <li>Specially designed to dampen noise and reduce vibration.</li>
                <li>Includes high-insulating shims and specially formulated grease.</li>
                </ul></p></li>
                <li><p>Brake rotors are vital to dissipating the heat that comes from the pads every time you brake. Honda Genuine Brake Rotors are built to take that heat time and again for lasting performance and reliability. They’re made with the optimum mix of materials and compounds to safely withstand long periods of wear and to help prevent overheating and warping.</p></li>
                <li><p>At the center of your electrical system is the battery, powering your air conditioner, sound system, headlights, instrument panel and other requisite components. Even in ideal conditions, all car batteries wear down over time – and the demands of extreme summer heat and brutal winter can shorten a battery’s lifespan even more. With batteries, dependability is of the essence, so choose Honda Genuine Replacement Battery. Each includes a 100 month limited warranty, 3 years free replacement.</p></li>
                <li><p>Tires impact your vehicle’s performance, fuel economy, ride, comfort and safety. As the miles add up, normal tread wear can gradually diminish your Honda’s handling and performance, especially in wet driving conditions. Your Honda technician can quickly check your tires for tread wear and correct air pressure. And when its time for replacement, count on your Honda Authorized Tire Center to install just the right tire for your specific vehicle.</p></li>
